Title: R Markdown tool for generation course websites and managing assignments
Description: This package implements my workflow for (1) creating websites for
    teaching courses in R, (2) using an R package to semi-automate student
    homework assignment tasks in a managed environment, as on an RStudio server, 
    and (3) provides an interface for students to manage Shiny app projects on 
    github and then deploy them to a Shiny server instance.  Any of these 3 
    components can be disabled.
