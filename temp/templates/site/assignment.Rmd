## R Markdown

Print out a summary of the `cars` data set:

```{r solution}
# name chuncks with solution code 'solution'

summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

Plot the variable `pressure`:

```{r solution}
plot(pressure)
```

Additional chunk options are carried over:

```{r solution, comment="Something interesting"}
plot(pressure)
```

Chuncks not named `solution` are left unchanged:

```{r}
print("hello normal chunk!")
```
