## R Markdown

Print out a summary of the `cars` data set:

```{r answer-1, task=1}
# Enter your code here!

```

## Including Plots

Plot the variable `pressure`:

```{r answer-2, task=2}
# Enter your code here!

```

Additional chunk options are carried over:

```{r answer-3, task=3, comment="Something interesting"}
# Enter your code here!

```

Chuncks not named `solution` are left unchanged:

```{r}
print("hello normal chunk!")
```
