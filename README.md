# courseR

An experiment in developing an efficient workflow for producing coures materials for classes that make heavy use of R with these features:

1.  Have a simple, easy to write and read source format (RMD)
2.  Generate course materials in HTML
3.  TODO: Generate pretty, portable presentation slides from the same source
