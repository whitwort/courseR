#courseR

An expierment in developing an efficient workflow with these goals:

1.  Have a simple, easy to write and read source format (~markdown) that also supports literate programming with R
2.  Generate very pretty, very portable presentation slides (targets frameworks like reveal.js or deck.js)
3.  Also generate accompanying course materials (HTML), preferable from the same source

A sample project in which I'm using courseR as the html-generation backend can be found [here](https://github.com/whitwort/bio285).
