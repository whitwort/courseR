#courseR

An expierment in developing an efficient workflow with these goals:

1.  Have a simple, easy to write and read source format (~markdown) that also supports literate programming with R
2.  Generate very pretty, very portable presentation slides (targets frameworks reveal.js or deck.js)
3.  Also generates accompanying course materials (HTML or PDF?), preferable from the same source

Not much to see here yet, though.
