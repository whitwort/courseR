# RNA Transcribe Solutions

> this is a really big block quote.

## Yours...

## Mine:
``` {r}
transcribe <- function(dnaFile, rnaFile) {
  
  #Read the file
  dna <- readLines(dnaFile)
  
  #Substitute U's for T's
  rna <- gsub(pattern     = "T", 
              replacement = "U",
              x           = dna, 
              fixed       = TRUE
             )
  
  #Save the results
  write(rna, rnaFile)
  
}
````

Take a moment to see how I've formatted the call to `sub`.  The formatting here is designed to make this function as easy to read as possible.  R doesn't care if your code is pretty or not; if it has correct syntax it will read it just fine ([lexical analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis)).  But if you write ugly code you and others will have trouble reading it in the future.  

## An ugly version

This function is equivalent to the last one, but ugly.

``` {r}
transcribe <- function(f1,f2) {write(sub("T","U",readLines(f1),fixed=TRUE), f2)}
````

## To use it:
``` {r warning=FALSE}
transcribe("dna.txt", "rna.txt")
````

# So how would we tackle the translation problem?

# Time for a table

## It'd be nice to be working with the genetic code in table format.

## Look at the contents of translationTable.txt

This is a "tab-delimited" file.

You can make one in a text editor, Excel, Minitab, etc...

## The read.* family of functions load tabular data into R

``` {r}
#Read a tab-delimited file
translationTable <- read.delim("translationTable.txt", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
````

What's up with the `stringsAsFactors = FALSE` part?  Factors are a more advanced topic, so we're not going to get into them today (but we *will*).  Try ommiting this argument to `read.delim` and see what happens when you run through the exercises below.  It's close to the same result.

## If you have comma-separated file

``` {r error=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
myTable <- read.csv("myTable.csv")
````

## If you need finer control over how the table is loaded

``` {r}
?read.table
````

# Tables

## It's not a number, it's not a string...

``` {r}
#Class tells you what kind of data a variable holds

#So far we've seen
class("hello")
class(100)

#We've also used TRUE as an argument for a function...
class(TRUE)

#The other logical value is FALSE
class(FALSE)

#So what's our translationTable?
class(translationTable)
````

## The R terminology for a table is a "data.frame"

How does the structure of translationTable related to our original file?

  row.names |	aminoacid
  --------- | ---------
  GCU	      | A
  GCC	      | A
  GCA	      | A

The relationship between the column headings in a data.frame the the original file can be a bit tricky to understand when you first start working with tables in R.

## Two flavors of data.frame (depending on your data)

* Unique values in the 1st column (row.names)
* Non-unique values in the 1st column (no row.names)

When you use one of the simple read.* functions, R will try to figure out whether or not it can treat the values in the left-most column as unique.  If it can, it will make a `data.frame` with a `row.names` column on the left side of the table.  In this case, you want the heading line of your file to have one *fewer* labels than you have columns.  See how I did this in translationTable.txt?

If your left most column does **not** contain unique values, R will add a new left-hand column that just contains numbers (1..n where n is the number of rows you have).  You'll see why we want to have some kind of unique label for each row in our `data.frame` objects in a moment.

# Sidebar:  Extract & Replace

Remember how we mentioned that the fundamental data type in R is the vector and then I promised that this would be both hard for you to wrap your heads around at first, but also extremely powerful?  Well, prepare to have your minds blown because we're about to see our first real `vectorized` operations in R!

## Let's say we have a vector of numbers:
``` {r}
myNumbers <- c(10,20,30,40,50)
````

Here's how we can `extract` a subset of vector:
``` {r}
myNumbers
myNumbers[1]
myNumbers[3]
````

## What if we want more than one at once?
``` {r}
myNumbers
myNumbers[c(1,3)]
````

What happened there?

## How can we extract a range of numbers?
``` {r}
# The : operator creates a series of numbers
1:5
2:10

# We can use this inside of our [...]
myNumbers
myNumbers[2:3]
````

## We can also use logical vectors

TRUE = keep it
FALSE = don't

``` {r}
myNumbers
myNumbers[c(FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE)]
myNumbers[c(TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE)]
````

## Now things get interesting!

``` {r}
myNumbers
myNumbers[TRUE]
myNumbers[c(TRUE,FALSE)]
````

## All operations in R are vectorized...

Yesterday we saw that the `+` works on vectors. 

Others basic math operators:
``` {r warning=FALSE}
myNumbers
myNumbers + 5
myNumbers - 5
myNumbers * c(10,0)
myNumbers / 0.1
````

## ...including comparison!

``` {r}
myNumbers
myNumbers > 25
myNumbers < 25

#Equality comparison uses == instead of =
myNumbers == 30

# The `!` operator negates logical vectors ("not")
myNumbers != 30
!(myNumbers > 25)
````

To compare equality we use the `==` operator.  This is to prevent confusion with the `=` which is used to pass arguments to functions (or do assignment like `<-`).  This will probably trip you up at first, but you'll get used to it.  See what happens if you run `myNumbers = 30`.


## So what does it all mean?

We can use our extraction operators `[` `]` to filter data in our vectors.

This is a very common idiom in R:
``` {r}
myNumbers
myNumbers[myNumbers > 25]
myNumbers[myNumbers < 25]
````

## You can get fancy...

Explore the parts of this code, then explain what it does:
``` {r}
myNumbers[ (myNumbers %% 4) == 0 ]
````

## You can use [] to replace data too!
``` {r}
myNumbers
myNumbers[3] <- 100
myNumbers
myNumbers[2:3] <- c(1,2)
myNumbers
````

# Back to our table

## The [] operators work with data.frames as well

``` {r}
# You can subset tables on a column: table[col]
## translationTable[1]

# You can subset tables on both a row and a column
translationTable[3,1]

#If you leave out the column, but keep the , you'll get all columns
translationTable[3,]
````

## You can use text to refer to columns or rows by name

Only works for rows if your `data.frame` has unique `row.name`'s

``` {r}
translationTable["GUC","aminoacid"]
translationTable["GUC",]

#Oh hey!  Remember vectors?
translationTable[c("GUA","UAG"),]

#... and logicals?
translationTable[c(TRUE,FALSE),]
````

## A couple other tricks...
``` {r}
#If your table has row names, you can get a vector of them with:
row.names(translationTable)

#The $ is a short hand notation for selecting a column of data from a table
translationTable$aminoacid
````

## Your turn #1

Subset the table to return a vector of all of the codons which encode valine
"V"

## Your turn #2

Write a function that takes a RNA codon and returns the amino acid.

``` {r}
translateRNA <- function(codon) {

  #Insert your code here

}
````

``` {r include=FALSE}
translateRNA <- function(codon) {
  translationTable[codon,]
}
````

Make sure it works:
``` {r}
translateRNA("UAU")
````

How might this function be useful in a script designed to translate dna.txt?

For a full reference on extraction and replacement operators in R, you can search for "[" in the Rstudio search box, or run `help("[")` at the prompt.

# Subsetting strings

## We're getting close!  

We can translate codons...
``` {r}
translateRNA("UGG")
````
...but we need to be able to read a string of letters in sets of 3.
``` {r}
sampleRNA <- "GTAGCTGGCAAGTTAATAGAGATGGAAAAC"
````

## Side bar: length of a string

Figuring out the number of characters in a piece of text is a little funny...

``` {r}
sampleRNA
length(sampleRNA)
length(c("A","B"))

#Number of characters in a string
nchar(sampleRNA)
nchar(c("A","B"))
````

What happened there?


## Side bar: subsetting a string

Similarly, subsetting a string vector is a little funny...
``` {r}
sampleRNA
sampleRNA[1]
c("A","B")[1]
sampleRNA[1:2]
c("A","B")[1:2]

# Use substr to pull characters out of a string
substr(sampleRNA, start = 1, stop = 3)
substr(c("ABCD","EFGH"), start = 1, stop = 3)
````

## Subsetting some codons

Our first codon is...
``` {r}
substr(sampleRNA, start = 1, stop = 3)
````

Our second codon is...
``` {r}
substr(sampleRNA, start = 4, stop = 6)
````

Our third codon is...
``` {r}
substr(sampleRNA, start = 7, stop = 9)
````

## Seeing the pattern

Our n'th codon is...
``` {r}
n <- 4
substr(sampleRNA, start = (n * 3) - 2, stop = n * 3)
````

Our last codon is...
``` {r}
substr(sampleRNA, start = nchar(sampleRNA) - 2, stop = nchar(sampleRNA))
````

## Your turn #3

Write a function that takes a codon number `n` and returns the sequence

``` {r}
getCodon <- function(n) {

  #Insert your code here

}
````

``` {r include=FALSE}
getCodon <- function(n) {
  substr(sampleRNA, start = (n * 3) - 2, stop = n * 3)
}
````

Make sure it works:
``` {r}
getCodon(5)
````

## Almost there..

That's great, but now we need to generate a series of codon numbers (1..n)

We've seen the parts that let us do this!
``` {r}
codonNumbers <- 1:( nchar(sampleRNA) / 3)
codonNumbers
````

# Apply Magic

The last piece in the puzzle is applying our `getCodon` to our `codonNumbers`

The *apply family of functions in R is:

* very powerful
* a little overwhelming at first

## sapply

For this task we'll use **s**apply.  We'll look at the other apply's later.

Let's see it in action:
``` {r}
sapply(codonNumbers, FUN = getCodon)
````

What happened there?

# Task #1

## Put it all together!

I've given you all of the pieces we need to write a translator.
Now you have to play with them and put it all together.

## The outline of your final function should look like
``` {r}
translate <- function(dnaFile) {
  
  #Do stuff here!

}
````

# Challenge #1

Translate all 6 possible open reading frames

# Challenge #2

Find the open reading frame that is most likely the real one!
