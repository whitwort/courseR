# Content pages

Content R Markdown documents are built into HTML documents and included in the "Pages" dropdown on the website navigation bar.  For the default "page view", the final document included in the website will be very similar/identical to what you would get with a normal **ad hoc** knit of the source document.  However, content sources are also built to a "slide view" using the [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) template.

# Slide View

## Lists

For slide view, lists are animated by default:

* list items
* animate by default

## Clickies

Top headings (H1) scroll to the right, sub-headings (H2) scroll down.  For example:

## This slide will go down

down...

## This will go down again

...floor!

##

You can also use blank headings to explicitly insert slide transitions

##

As in this example.

## Large blocks of text are removed by default

By default, when slides are generated large blocks of text are removed.
