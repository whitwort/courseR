# Welcome to courseR!

``` {r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#Example from http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/geom_histogram.html

This is an example courseR content page.  The header configuration on this file is an example of how we can turn off generation of particular output types defined in the default `courseR.yaml` file (in this case, generation of HTML slides).

# Next steps

See the `README.md` file in the project root directory for more information about the default file structure of courseR projects.  See `courseR.yaml` and R help pages for information about more advanced customization options.
